# Enhancing Operating System Insights: Monitoring User Programs with eBPF

## Introduction
- **Context**: The extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) is a powerful technology in the Linux kernel, allowing safe and efficient monitoring and manipulation of network traffic and system calls.
- **Importance**: Monitoring user programs is crucial for system security, performance optimization, and debugging.
- **Objective**: Develop a sophisticated tool for real-time monitoring of user program interactions with the Linux kernel using eBPF.

## Project Goals and Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Create an eBPF-based tool for detailed user program behavior monitoring.
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Master eBPF technical aspects and their application in system monitoring.
  - Analyze user program behavior and system resource interactions.
  - Enhance Linux system programming and performance analysis skills.

## Literature Review
- **Key Sources**: Research works such as "Linux Observability with BPF" by David Calavera and Lorenzo Fontana.
- **Innovation Opportunities**: Identify gaps in current monitoring tools in granularity, overhead, and real-time analysis.

## Methodology
- **eBPF Mechanics**: Discuss eBPF operation within the Linux kernel.
- **Monitoring Strategy**: Plan to monitor system calls, network traffic, and resource allocation.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Use BCC, bpftrace, and programming in C and Python.

## Project Plan
- **Development Phases**:
  1. **Phase 1: Research and Design** (2 weeks)
  2. **Phase 2: Implementation of Core Functionality** (4 weeks)
  3. **Phase 3: Testing and Optimization** (3 weeks)
  4. **Phase 4: Documentation and Final Evaluation** (1 week)
- **Milestones**: Creation of eBPF scripts, initial tool testing, and optimization.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Tool Features**: A tool providing real-time data on system calls, network usage, and resource allocation.
- **Benefits**: A powerful diagnostic and performance tuning tool for administrators and developers.

## Evaluation
- **Testing Approach**: Test using various user programs for accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure tool performance in system overhead, data accuracy, and real-time efficiency.

## Conclusion
- Highlight the project's contribution to operating system monitoring and the innovative use of eBPF.
