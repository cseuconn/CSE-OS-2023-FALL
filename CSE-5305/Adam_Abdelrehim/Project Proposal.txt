The project I am proposing is a multi-threaded Sudoku puzzle solver. The Program takes in an inputted Sudoku board, and outputs a correct solution to the input. The program will utilize mutexs and conditional variables, and will attempt to determine if a solution is viable or not. Once a solution is found, all threads will be terminated, and the solution will be returned.
